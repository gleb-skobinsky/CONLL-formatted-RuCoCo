# CONLL-formatted-RuCoCo
This repository contains data of the RuCoCo corpus converted to CONLL-2012 and SACR

RuCoCo (https://github.com/vdobrovolskii/rucoco) files were first converted to SACR format (scripts for conversion are included in this repo) and then converted from SACR to CONLL (see folder conll_data).
